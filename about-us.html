<p>It takes a special bean to become a coffee. We will sample over 150,000 cups a year looking for the very best arabica coffees. In the end, only about 3% of the 
world's beans makes it into a bag of our coffee.

Coffee buyers spend about 18 weeks each year visiting coffee growers and suppliers. These relationships are critical to our future success � they solidify our role 
as champions of quality and progress at every level of the coffee business. It is because of these relationships that our Coffee brand gets the first pick of some of the world's 
best coffee crops. Many of our relationships with farms and suppliers go back more than 20 years.
